## What Are Analysis Units?

Analysis units represent AI reasoning and processing. They are consumed when the system performs:

- Process extraction from conversations
- Opportunity scanning and matching
- Tool evaluation and recommendations
- Blueprint generation
- Governance analysis

Units are **not** consumed when:
- Viewing sessions or artifacts
- Reading outputs
- Editing notes
- Navigating the workspace

---

## Pay-As-You-Go (Pro and Enterprise only)

When your monthly units are exhausted, you can enable pay-as-you-go to continue working.

**How it works:**
- Explicit opt-in required (never auto-enabled)
- Set a monthly cap between €10 and €500
- €0.04 per additional unit
- Disable at any time

**Example:**
A Pro user exhausts 3,500 units mid-month. They enable pay-as-you-go with a €50 cap. This provides up to 1,250 additional units. If the cap is reached, AI actions pause again until the cap is increased or the next billing cycle.

---

## Usage Visibility

Your workspace displays a usage indicator showing consumption relative to your monthly allowance. Detailed breakdowns are available in account settings.

Warnings appear at 75% and 90% usage. When the limit is reached, a clear message explains available options.

---

## Billing Principles

- No surprise charges
- Pay-as-you-go requires explicit consent
- Monthly caps prevent runaway costs
- Failed AI calls do not consume units
- Usage resets on the first of each month (UTC)
