## 5. Simple Funnel

1. **Attention:** Humorous posts about interns, broken workflows, and AI confusion.
2. **Interest:** Short Loom demo of process → opportunity → blueprint.
3. **Sign-up:** Landing page with clear value and zero fluff.
4. **Activation:** Onboarding that pushes user to map *one* process immediately.
5. **Expansion:** Encourage more projects and pitch to consultants as a client-facing tool.

## 6. Early Metrics to Watch
